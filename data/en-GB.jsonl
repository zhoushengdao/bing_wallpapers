Although the idea didn't gain traction initially, it was revived in 1909 by Sonora Smart Dodd of Spokane, Washington, United States.

From David Bowie and Elton John to Metallica and Billie Eilish, Glastonbury's stages have hosted performances that have defined generations. This year's festival runs from today through June 29, with The 1975, Neil Young and Olivia Rodrigo topping the bill.
