The festival is deeply rooted in the ideals of the hippie movement, the 1960s counterculture and the free festival spirit that sparked its early days. From David Bowie and Elton John to Metallica and Billie Eilish, Glastonbury's stages have hosted performances that have defined generations. This year's festival runs from today through June 29, with The 1975, Neil Young and Olivia Rodrigo topping the bill. Overlooking the event is Glastonbury Tor, pictured here, a hill crowned by the 14th-century St. Michael's Church Tower.

This frog lives high in the canopies of Central and South America, especially in Costa Rica, Panama and parts of Ecuador and Colombia. With vertical pupils and a golden glow, its oversized eyes help this frog spot prey in the dark. Thanks to sticky toe pads and strong limbs, it can cling to branches and leaves like a pro, even in the canopy's slippery heights. Breeding season gets creative.

Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, the uprising challenged not only police brutality but society's silence. Stonewall wasn't the beginning of queer existence, but it was the moment people said 'no more' loud enough to be heard worldwide. Today, Stonewall stands as a symbol of resilience.

The name comes from Sanskrit: 'Van' meaning forest and 'Mahotsav' meaning grand festival. This green tradition was started in July 1947 by an Indian historian and botanist, Mohinder Singh Randhawa. In 1950, Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi, then Minister of Food and Agriculture, made it an annual event in the first week of July, officially naming it Van Mahotsav.", "headline": "A green escape", "quiz_url": "https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:\"HPQuiz_20250701_KeralaHouseboats\"&FORM=BGAQ", "map_image": "https://platform.bing.com/geo/REST/v1/Imagery/Map/RoadVibrant/9.85,76.35/5?key=AsSOKo7OOz5VAtfAj0rjgaXlhCrCZI6PGbLj7GCH8IW2HUalyg4BVhqA0z77PRCj&c=en-IN&od=2&shading=flat&pp=9.85,76.35;S9;Vembanad lake, Kerala&st=pp|v:false;lv:false_trs|v:false;lv:false&ml=Basemap,Landmarks&logo=no&mapSize=386,434&da=ro", "map_url": "https://www.bing.com/maps?ty=30&q=Vembanad&satid=id.sid%3A6be53380-27e3-2060-9538-353eef7157e8&vdpid=7479081947772223489&mb=9.870294~76.314652~9.839702~76.366992&cardbg=%23F98745&dt=1748863800000&tt=Vembanad%2C%20India&tsts0=%2526ty%253D30%2526q%253DVembanad%2526satid%253Did.sid%25253A6be53380-27e3-2060-9538-353eef7157e8%2526vdpid%253D7479081947772223489%2526mb%253D9.870294~76.314652~9.839702~76.366992%2526cardbg%253D%252523F98745%2526dt%253D1748863800000&tstt0=Vembanad%2C%20India&cp=9.716862~75.602741&lvl=7.944016&pi=0&ftst=0&ftics=False&v=2&sV=2&form=BGAM"}

That's the spine-cheeked anemonefish, or the maroon clownfish, and it is not just a cute creature. Native to the Indo-Pacific, from western Indonesia to Taiwan and the Great Barrier Reef, this species lives on the edges of coral reefs. This fish is easily distinguished by the spine extending from each cheek—hence the name. Groups of spine-cheeked anemonefish form around a single dominant female, and if she disappears, the top male steps up—literally changing sex to take her place. It thrives in warm, shallow waters and sticks close to its chosen sea anemone. The closest marine companion of a spine-cheeked anemonefish is the bubble-tip anemone, as seen in the image. These anemones don't all look alike—their appearances often vary with age, depth and whether they host anemonefish. This species offers the perfect mix of cover and protection.", "headline": "In the bubble-tip zone", "quiz_url": "https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:\"HPQuiz_20250702_MaroonClownfish\"&FORM=BGAQ", "map_image": "https://platform.bing.com/geo/REST/v1/Imagery/Map/RoadVibrant/-10.25,150/5?key=AsSOKo7OOz5VAtfAj0rjgaXlhCrCZI6PGbLj7GCH8IW2HUalyg4BVhqA0z77PRCj&c=en-IN&od=2&shading=flat&pp=-10.25,150;S9;Milne Bay, Papua New Guinea&st=pp|v:false;lv:false_trs|v:false;lv:false&ml=Basemap,Landmarks&logo=no&mapSize=386,434&da=ro", "map_url": "https://www.bing.com/maps?ty=30&q=Milne%20Bay%2C%20Papua%20New%20Guinea&satid=id.sid%3A66e1bdd9-429a-5826-35c5-098ee0ef3a07&vdpid=8806624178183602177&mb=-8.100845~148.900213~-11.855584~156.140467&cardbg=%23F98745&tt=Milne%20Bay%2C%20Papua%20New%20Guinea&tsts0=%2526ty%253D30%2526q%253DMilne%252520Bay%25252C%252520Papua%252520New%252520Guinea%2526satid%253Did.sid%25253A66e1bdd9-429a-5826-35c5-098ee0ef3a07%2526vdpid%253D8806624178183602177%2526mb%253D-8.100845~148.900213~-11.855584~156.140467%2526cardbg%253D%252523F98745&tstt0=Milne%20Bay%2C%20Papua%20New%20Guinea&cp=-17.086343~136.649065&lvl=4.5174284&pi=0&ftst=0&ftics=False&v=2&sV=2&form=BGAM"}

This enchanting locale blends mountainous charm with pristine coastal beauty—the nearby Gulf of Orosei and the Gennargentu massif form a protected regional park. The coastline stretches 20 kilometres, featuring a mix of white sandy beaches and rocky cliffs, vibrant by day and lively on summer nights. Every May, the town celebrates the festivals of Sant'Isidoro and Santa Maria 'e Mare with traditional processions.
