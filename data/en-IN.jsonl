The festival is deeply rooted in the ideals of the hippie movement, the 1960s counterculture and the free festival spirit that sparked its early days. From David Bowie and Elton John to Metallica and Billie Eilish, Glastonbury's stages have hosted performances that have defined generations. This year's festival runs from today through June 29, with The 1975, Neil Young and Olivia Rodrigo topping the bill. Overlooking the event is Glastonbury Tor, pictured here, a hill crowned by the 14th-century St. Michael's Church Tower.

This frog lives high in the canopies of Central and South America, especially in Costa Rica, Panama and parts of Ecuador and Colombia. With vertical pupils and a golden glow, its oversized eyes help this frog spot prey in the dark. Thanks to sticky toe pads and strong limbs, it can cling to branches and leaves like a pro, even in the canopy's slippery heights. Breeding season gets creative.

Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, the uprising challenged not only police brutality but society's silence. Stonewall wasn't the beginning of queer existence, but it was the moment people said 'no more' loud enough to be heard worldwide. Today, Stonewall stands as a symbol of resilience.

That's the spine-cheeked anemonefish, or the maroon clownfish, and it is not just a cute creature. Native to the Indo-Pacific, from western Indonesia to Taiwan and the Great Barrier Reef, this species lives on the edges of coral reefs. This fish is easily distinguished by the spine extending from each cheek—hence the name. Groups of spine-cheeked anemonefish form around a single dominant female, and if she disappears, the top male steps up—literally changing sex to take her place. It thrives in warm, shallow waters and sticks close to its chosen sea anemone. The closest marine companion of a spine-cheeked anemonefish is the bubble-tip anemone, as seen in the image.

Lavender has flourished in Provence for centuries. The ancient Romans brought the plant to southern France, using it for bathing, cooking and healing. Today, 1,700 growers tend to do more than 200 square kilometres of these shrubs. They cultivate both traditional lavender—for perfumes and skincare—and lavandin, the longer-stemmed cousin often found in household cleaning products and air fresheners.

From pub basements to park benches, stages appear in the strangest places and shows pop up on quiet streets. Welcome to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, or the Fringe. The story began in 1947, when eight theatre groups turned up uninvited to the Edinburgh International Festival. They performed anyway. That spirit of rebellion stuck, and the Fringe was born.", "headline": "Expect the unexpected", "quiz_url": "https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:\"HPQuiz_20250801_EdinburghFringe\"&FORM=BGAQ", "map_image": "https://platform.bing.com/geo/REST/v1/Imagery/Map/RoadVibrant/55.95333,-3.189167/5?key=AsSOKo7OOz5VAtfAj0rjgaXlhCrCZI6PGbLj7GCH8IW2HUalyg4BVhqA0z77PRCj&c=en-IN&od=2&shading=flat&pp=55.95333,-3.189167;S9;Edinburgh, Scotland&st=pp|v:false;lv:false_trs|v:false;lv:false&ml=Basemap,Landmarks&logo=no&mapSize=386,434&da=ro", "map_url": "https://www.bing.com/maps?ty=30&q=Edinburgh%20Scotland&satid=id.sid%3A286af946-edea-5f33-df53-4164821c69da&vdpid=5469806147366027267&mb=56.009747~-3.377998~55.896972~-3.000281&cardbg=%23F98745&tt=Edinburgh%2C%20City%20of%20Edinburgh&tsts0=%2526ty%253D30%2526q%253DEdinburgh%252520Scotland%2526satid%253Did.sid%25253A286af946-edea-5f33-df53-4164821c69da%2526vdpid%253D5469806147366027267%2526mb%253D56.009747~-3.377998~55.896972~-3.000281%2526cardbg%253D%252523F98745&tstt0=Edinburgh%2C%20City%20of%20Edinburgh&cp=53.371115~0.423183&lvl=5.256061&pi=0&ftst=0&ftics=False&v=2&sV=2&form=BGAM"}

Their connection to the land was both spiritual and practical—and they left behind some of the park's most captivating features, including petroglyphs like those found in Fruita, featured in today's image.
